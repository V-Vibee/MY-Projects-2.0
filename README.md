**A Brief:** 
Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time. In time series analysis, analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly. However, this type of analysis is not merely the act of collecting data over time. 
What sets time series data apart from other data is that the analysis can show how variables change over time. In other words, time is a crucial variable because it shows how the data adjusts over the course of the data points as well as the final results. It provides an additional source of information and a set order of dependencies between the data.


**Usage:**
Time series analysis is used for non-stationary dataâ€”things that are constantly fluctuating over time or are affected by time. Industries like finance, retail, and economics frequently use time series analysis because currency and sales are always changing.Time series helps turn raw data into insights, companies can use this to improve performance and track historical outcomes. For example, retailers might look at seasonal sales patterns to adapt their inventory and marketing. Energy companies could use consumption trends to optimize their production schedule.



**What is it used for..?**
Time series forecasting means to forecast or to predict the future value over a period of time. It entails developing models based on previous data and applying them to make observations and guide future strategic decisions.



**Certain Aspects of Time Series:**
1. Stationarity is a crucial aspect of a time series. A time series is determined to be stationary when its statistical properties such as the average (mean) and the variance do not alter over time. It has a constant variance and mean, and the covariance is separate from time.
2. Seasonality refers to periodic fluctuations. For example, if you consider electricity consumption, it is typically high during the day and lowers during the night. In the case of shopping patterns, online sales spike during the holidays before slowing down and dropping.
3. Autocorrelation is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. Plotting autocorrelated data yields a graph similar to a sinusoidal function.


**Limitations**
Time series analysis is restricted to time-dependent data. It's not suitable for cross-sectional or purely categorical data. Noise Introduction: Techniques like differencing can introduce additional noise into the data, which may obscure fundamental patterns or trends
Also sometimes we may not be able to predict sudden changes in market trends or price movements, as such they can give false signals. Moving averages are based on historical data, and they can be affected by sudden price spikes or dips or in some case uncertainity
