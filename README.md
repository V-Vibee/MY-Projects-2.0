**Benefits:**
- Detect Phishing and vishing.
- Prevent Stolen or lost credit cards.
- Timely detection of Account takeover fraud.




**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Linear Regression.
2. Decison Tree.
3. Random Forest.
4. XG Boost.
   
**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing/ Cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Data Scaling & Feature engineering
- Handling imbalanced data- using SMOTE.
- Build Model, checked accuracy score but we cannot rely on it since fraudulent activities are very minute hence we need to rely on Precision, Reacall and F1 score report to get more efficiency.
- Evaluating ROC Curve


 


**Finally Random Forest model was selected, since it showed better result and was accurate by 99.99%**


**Tips to avoid Credit Card Fraud:**
- Review statements regularly/ Check your credit report.
