 # Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Binary Classification 






**Introduction:** 

**Why is Analyzing Customer Churn Prediction Important..?** 

**What is it used for..?** 


**Benefits of Analyzing Customer Churn Prediction:**




**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Linear Regression.
2. Support Vectoir Machine.
3. Decison Tree.
4. Random Forest.
5. XG Boost.
   
**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing/ Cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Handling imbalanced data- using SMOTE.
- Model Build , checked accuracy score but we cannot take it since fraudulent activities are minute we rely on Precision, Reacall and F1 score via classifictaion report.


 **Best Model Selection Criterion**
