**Benefits:**





**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Linear Regression.
2. Decison Tree.
3. Random Forest.
4. XG Boost.
   
**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing/ Cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Data Scaling & Feature engineering
- H


 


**Finally Random Forest model was selected, since it showed better result and was accurate by 99.99%**
