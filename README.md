**Introduction:**
Employee turnover refers to the rate at which employees leave a company and are replaced by new hires. It can be voluntary (resignations) or involuntary (layoffs, terminations). High turnover can indicate issues with job satisfaction, company culture, or other factors, while low turnover often suggests a stable and positive work environment. Tracking and analyzing turnover rates can help organizations improve retention strategies and address underlying problems..

**Why is Analyzing Employee turnover so Important considering the latest developments across industry/companies..?** 

Understanding employee turnover is so crucial for employers because of the following reasons:

1. Cost Management: High turnover can lead to increased recruitment and training costs for a company and can induce a huge cost.
2. Productivity: Frequent turnover can disrupt team dynamics and decrease productivity of overall staffs.
3. Employee Morale: High turnover can affect remaining employeesâ€™ morale and engagement.
4. Company Culture: Turnover rates can indicate issues within the workplace culture which is not at all a gud scenario.
5. Retention Strategies: Identifying turnover causes can help improve retention strategies and employee satisfaction.
By analyzing turnover, employers can enhance employee experience and business outcomes.



**Benefits of Analyzing Customer Sentiment:**
1. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction.
2. Proactive Issue Resolution
3. Improved Product and Service Quality.
4. Increased Customer Loyalty.
5. Competitive Advantage.
6. Boosted Sales and Revenue.
7. Efficient Resource Allocation



**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Random Forest.

   
**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Encoding both categorical as well as numerical Features.
- Model Building using Column Transformer and Data Pipelines, Hypertuning and fitting the Models.
- Finally selecting the model based on classification report and accuracy score.


 **Conclusion** 
 
Here both Random forest and SVM were showing the accuracy of of 80% hence any can be chosen from both.
For this i have choosed Random Forest model to precheck the accuracy in GUI to see how it works**
