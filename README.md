**Introduction:**
Employee turnover refers to the rate at which employees leave a company and are replaced by new hires. It can be voluntary (resignations) or involuntary (layoffs, terminations). High turnover can indicate issues with job satisfaction, company culture, or other factors, while low turnover often suggests a stable and positive work environment. Tracking and analyzing turnover rates can help organizations improve retention strategies and address underlying problems..

**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Random Forest.

   
**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Encoding both categorical as well as numerical Features.
- Model Building using Column Transformer and Data Pipelines, Hypertuning and fitting the Models.
- Finally selecting the model based on classification report and accuracy score.


 **Conclusion** 
 
Here both Random forest and SVM were showing the accuracy of of 80% hence any can be chosen from both.
For this i have choosed Random Forest model to precheck the accuracy in GUI to see how it works**
