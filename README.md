**Mall Customer Segmentation: Clustering & Analysis**

![Customer Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/V-Vibee/My-Projects-2.0/assets/91024678/4ea008c4-6679-4edd-8521-5583b27925e8)


**Context:** 
This data set is to learn the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . It is demonstrated by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.


**Problem Statement:**
Here the owner of the mall is trying to understand the customerswho are likely to converted based on footfall & other factors who tends to spend more [Target Customers] Here we are trying to analyse the customers and segment them,so that it helps the marketing team to plan strategies accordingly.
