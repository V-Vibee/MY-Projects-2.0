**Introduction:**
Customer sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that leverages NLP and machine learning techniques to interpret and classify subjective information from textual data.

**Algorithms for Churn Prediction Models:**
Algorithms used here for Churn Prediction Models are.
1. Logistic Regression.
2. SVM.
3. Decison Tree.
4. Random Forest.

   
**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing/ Cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Using NLTK removed unwanted words.
- Model Building , checking accuracy score to know which model performs better.
- Final selecting the model and save as Joblib file.
- Cross check prediction using GUI window.


 **Conclusion** 
 
Here both Random forest and SVM were showing the accuracy of of 80% hence any can be chosen from both.
For this i have choosed Random Forest model to precheck the accuracy in GUI to see how it works**
